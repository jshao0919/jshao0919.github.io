    <h1>Welcome to Mathjock</h1>
    <p> As I start preparing for graduate school in Math I Intend on uploading solutions in honor of the original stemjock.com but exclusively for math. Any requests for solutions and specific textbooks 
        will be considered if you shoot an email to me at: jackshao223@gmail.com
    <p> Why not Latex? It's just Faster to get out problems on pen and paper and then scan them as a pdf. While Latex looks pretty and great I work on this alone and would rather have a larger volume 
        of solutions rather than having latex solutions with less.
